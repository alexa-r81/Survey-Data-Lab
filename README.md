#This was a very interesting data set. The column I studied was sharewomen, which is basically the share/percentage of women by major (I believe they were only STEM majors). The initial mean and median were roughly 44% and 41%, but when I did only engineering majors there was a significant drop to 24% mean and 23% median. This was very interesting to me because it really highlights how little the percent of women in engineering majors are compared to other majors, even though I believe all majors in the data set were STEM majors. Independently I learned how to get the maximum and minimum of a column. I think this was something valueable to learn because it could be pretty useful, and it showed me how much stuff python has that I just haven't even considered using.
